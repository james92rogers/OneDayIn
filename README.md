## Overview: ##

For my third project as part of General Assembly’s Software Engineering course, we were assigned into teams and told to make a full MERN stack application in just over a week. In our first meeting together, my team decided to create a travel website, but to make it differ slightly from the Trip Advisor’s of the world, ours would be specific for if you had 24 hours in a specific city.

## The Brief: ##

* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end.
* Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
* Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. ALLOW time for this.
* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.


## Technologies Used: ##

* Node.js
* Mongodb
* Express
* Bcrypt
* Mongoose
* jsonwebtoken
* React
* Axios
* SASS
* React Bootstrap
* Insomnia
* Git
* GitHub
* Trello Board (planning and timeline)

## Code Installation: ##

* Clone or download the repo, then in your terminal run the following commands:
* Start the database by running: `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db`
* In the OneDayIn folder, run: `yarn`
* Start the back-end server first running: `yarn serve`
* Start the front-end by first running: `cd client` followed by: `yarn start`

## Day 1 - Planning:##

Once we had decided the theme for the app the next thing we did was create a Trello board to help us keep on top of our planning. Here we created sections for our wireframes, endpoints, and models that we would need to have done in order to get sign-off. We ended up using this Trello board across the entire project.
