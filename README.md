For my third project as part of General Assembly’s Software Engineering course, we were assigned into teams and told to make a full MERN stack application in just over a week. In our first meeting together, my team decided to create a travel website, but to make it differ slightly from the Trip Advisor’s of the world, ours would be specific for if you had 24 hours in a specific city.
